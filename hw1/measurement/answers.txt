Q2: I am assuming the average latency is L1 + L2 + L3, which is 80.178 + 20.443 + 60.536 = 161.157, since latency is accumulated through each switches,
the actual average latency  is 161.223, it is a little higher than my expectations. I am guessing there are some latency when transmitting within each switches.
So the total latency is a little higher.   

For the throughput, it is probably the average of L1 , L2, and L3.
For sent throughput from my guess, it is (23.832 + 42.895 + 32.49)/3= 33.07 
For received throughput from my guess, it is (18.91+37.97+28.342)/3=28.407
The actual sent throughput is 22.575. Received is 18.524. The average throughput is 20.5495. It is way lower than my expectations. I think for the throughput, we can not use the average to estiamte. 
My better guess: It is better to use the lowest value from L1, L2, and L3 since it is better to use bottleneck segment. since the slowest segment cna not handle more data than
its throughput. 
A better estimation should be sent: 23.832, received : 18.91. The average is 21.371. It is similar to the actual throughput. 



Q3: two pairs: h8 - h4 h7 - h9
for the first pair(h8 h4), the sent throughput is 17.999, received throughput is 12.883. 
for the second pair(h7 h9), the sent throughput is 7.971, received throughput is 5.836.
The whole average throughput is 11.17
The throughput for communicating in 2 pairs is slower than communicating alone (half), since they all share the same pipe, everyone will get usually half of the space to transfer

the rtt for first pair is 160.991, for second pair is 161.181 the average one is 161.086
The rtt is doubled for communicating with 2 pairs than in 1 pair. The reason is that they share the network resources and there are the queuing delays 



three paris:h8 - h4 h7 - h9 h1 - h10
for the first pair(h8 h4), the sent throughput is 17.672 , received throughput is 13.116 
for the second pair(h7 h9), the sent throughput is 6.078 , received throughput is 4.728
for the third pair(h1 h10), the sent throughput is 1.987 , received throughput is 1.887
The total average throughput is 7.578, it is one in three of the single transmission. Since three things are sharing the same pipe simultaneously. 
 
the rtt for the first pair is 161.043 , for the second pair is 161.012 , for the third pair is 163.437 
The total average for rtt is 161.83, it is similar to the rtt in two pairs. It probably because the network buffer can remian consistently utilized.



Q4:
h1-h4:
My prediction: rtt is 160.991 since it is s1 to s4. THe throughput is 15, since for h8-h4, h7-h9, the throughput is 11.17
Now we are h1-h4 and h5-h6, h5-h6 is a little shorter, so the throughput needs to be higher

The actual rtt is 161.203, the sent throughput is 21.570 , received throughput is 18.017. The average throughput is 19.7935 


h5-h6:
My prediction: rtt is 53 (160/3) since h5 -h6 is 1 in 3 of h1- h4, but the actual one is lower than it, probably there is some delay on the switches.
The throughput prediction is 23, sinec for L4 and L5, the received throughput are both near 23, but the actual one is 20.553, probably there is some delay.

The actual rtt is 41.115, the sent throughput is 22.076, received throughput is 19.030. The average throughput is 20.553
